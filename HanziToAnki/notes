To do:
take chars, convert to list of unique chinese chars(using bash?) also may want to consider whether traditional or simplified and convert?, though this can come later, I just want something that works for now
then compare chars with the Open Source CEDICT dictionary, and extract the English(and maybe Pinyin)
Then put into some CSV format which (I think) can be imported into Anki
see http://superuser.com/questions/698902/can-i-create-an-anki-deck-from-a-csv-file
  you can actually create an apkg from Python


NOTES on importing into Anki:
It seems that the import failed unless I created a new note type for the card (I have no idea why really...)


The dictionary file is modified (I think) by removing the first 31 lines and then sorting alphabetically by pinyin
